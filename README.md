## Stakeholders

1. Jason: The first is that I don't know much about alcohol, but I want to buy it, so I want to check the app to see what the characteristics of each drink are; the second is that if I want to drink some cocktails, I want to check the characteristics of each cocktail through the app, and if I want to mix it by myself, it would be better if there is a tutorial on how to mix the cocktails. If it were me, my needs would be similar to what my goal said, I would want to know the characteristics of each drink when I buy the base drink, and then the flavor of the cocktail and how to make it.

2. Che Wang: For example, if I suddenly want to drink a German beer today, but all I've ever had before is American/regular beer, I can come up with the German beer I'm most likely to like by checking off the answers to some questions (like usual drinking interests). Then if say the person hasn't drank at all, but he probably loves a certain drink I guess, one can also come to a conclusion AS THE RECOMMENDATION TO HIM by using those INFORMATION.
Or let's say I usually drink Pinot Noir, and I suddenly want to try Cabernet Sauvignon today. Is it possible to recommend a Cabernet Sauvignon WITHIN MY BUDGET through my PREFERENCE for Pinot Noir?

3. Rain: The wine list must be comprehensive, then each wine can have a careful introduction, and then I would like to have the taste of this below, it is sweet, sour, dry this kind of introduction, and then there will be an APP user can go to score, for me is that I will feel that I know very clearly how the quality of the wine or taste. And I think that's when I logged into my account, and then he can ask me, OK, what kind of wine do you usually like to drink, and then it can recommend me a wine every day or every week through my preferences, and then I can go and try it. Then I can go and try it.

4. Gavinï¼š 1. all information about the wine: what type what taste how many degrees of origin price I mean all 2. recommended according to my preferences, occasions, physical condition, etc. 3. collection of all online all e-commerce companies give prices.
   
4 goals:
  1. Buy the wine you want with more accuracy
  2. Alcohol from different demographics
  3. Know other people's comment on each bottle
  4. Personalized experience
4 fruatrations that the app can help with: 
  1.Too much to choose from
  2.Don't understand the language on the bottles
  3.Not enough demographic selection
  4.Price does not match with taste
